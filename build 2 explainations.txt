BUILD REWORK 2
as i add multithrading have concurrency issues due to the changing maps and overlapping paths
the system I had previously implemented used child and parent nodes wouild have worked for a single path 
but when several paths are made at once and they overlap then the new paths would delete the old ones and the 
paths would be lost 
To overcome this and another concurrency issue with the map being constant across the threads and to minimise the use of global variables with the threads
I also have to change the way that I store my map 

SOlution
Use a adjacency list or matrix to hold my vertices on my graph 
then hold my paths in lists rather than nodes, these lists will have to be returned into the code at the end of the function 
and then used as parameters to the movement algorithm, this will also allow me to use localised pathfinding
